CVMob - Movement analysis tool
Copyright (C) 2012  The CVMob contributors

Build instructions:
CVMob requires OpenCV 2.0 and Qt 4.8 minimum in order to get built and
run. If they're in path, you just need to enter in the src directory
and run:

    cmake . && make

If you want to specify a different directory for both OpenCV and Qt,
you'll have to do:

    cmake . -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/OpenCV \
            -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/Qt/qmake

You can also set a custom prefix path, if both OpenCV and Qt are in it:

    cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt-and-opencv

Then, you can run:

    make

The cvmob executable will be inside src and you just need to run it
like any other executable file. Enjoy!
